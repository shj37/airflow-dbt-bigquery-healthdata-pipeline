# Automating Healthcare Data Pipelines with Apache Airflow, BigQuery, and dbt

![project overview](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*IXN5tDIpL0ZpIIVtzFckPQ.jpeg)

This project showcases a streamlined data pipeline built to handle healthcare data using modern data engineering tools. I used **Apache Airflow** (via Astronomer) to orchestrate workflows, **Google BigQuery** as a scalable data warehouse, and **dbt** for transformations and quality checks. 

Starting with synthetic data generation, the pipeline uploads data to **Google Cloud Storage**, creates external tables in **BigQuery**, and applies transformations—dynamically adapting to development and production environments. **Docker** ensured a consistent setup, while the solution highlights my ability to integrate cloud tools, automate processes, and maintain data quality.
